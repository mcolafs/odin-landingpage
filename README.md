This is the landing page on The Odin Project.
The task is to create a webpage by using the flex-box. 
I have solved the task by divinding the landing page in five sections. All of them flex-box with flex-direction column.
Each section is divided in various divs in order to place all the items on the right places.
I hve also tride to use flew-wrap, and flex-shrink/grow on some of the items. Need more practice on this bit.
